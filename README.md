# PhoneNumberSorter
A small program that sorts through and compares two given .txt files that each contain a list of phone numbers; 
.txt files must use a one-phone-number-per-line format. The program will search for differences between the two given 
files and delete those numbers from the first given list as long as it does not begin with the provided area code. 
This new list will then be stored in a .txt file, which the user can save to their desktop.
